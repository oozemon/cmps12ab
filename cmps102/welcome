Welcome to CATS/Athena
----------------------

- Project Athena was an eight-year experiment (1983-1991) to explore
  the use of computers in university educational programs.  The Project
  focused on developing computers as useful tools, rather than as
  objects of study, in the education of students at MIT.

- The Athena system, one of the fruits of Project Athena, is a
  campus-wide distributed computer service consisting of hundreds of
  networked workstations and related facilities (such as printers and
  file servers) at MIT.  The software has been imported by UCSC to be a
  foundation for the transition from time-sharing to workstations. It
  is available to students and faculty to help them achieve their
  academic goals and learn about computers.

- For help about any aspect of Athena, type:   help   followed by a
  carriage return (or  xhelp  if you are at an X workstation).  This
  calls the CATS on-line help system, a gopher-based menu browser that
  helps you find information about many topics.  For introductory
  guides on how to use Athena, look under:

	UNIX (includes Athena)
	Understanding UNIX-Athena
	Getting started

- If you have trouble, contact a consultant.  To get a consultant
  on-line, just type:  olc   followed by a carriage return.  Olc will
  also give you answers to the most commonly asked questions.  To talk
  to a student consultant in person, call X4693 (if there is no
  consultant on duty, you might someday get a recording informing you
  of the consulting schedule).
