Usman Zahid and Alex Hoyt
uzahid and adhoyt

 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
 at most 25% of an individuals effort for an assignment should
 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

 Alex Hoyt spent 1 hours working alone.
 Usman Zahid spent 1 hours working alone.
 We spent 3 hours working together.
 Alex Hoyt spent 1.5 hours driving.
 Usman Zahid spent 1.5 hours driving.
