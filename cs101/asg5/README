Hi Ryan Connors,

It should be running well and smooth. I checked the preconditions and
also made a more extensively testing graphtest. Thank you
for grading this quarter and best of luck in your future endeavours. 


***NEW NOTE****
I was altering my program further and was testing a bit extra and 
I accidently submitted and overwrote a file that I had previously
submitted and had perfect functionality. The new code I submitted 
has potential uninitialized variables due to the altering I had done.
If there is an issue with the functionality, please grade the 4-6th 
revision of the program, in those builds I did not encounter any issues
with funtionality. I'm not sure if that is possible, but if it is
and there is an error please check that code instead.
Thank you for your time.
