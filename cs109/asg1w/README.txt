CMPS 109 Program 2
Overloading and operators
7/14/15
------------------------------*/

This program overloads basic integer operators to perform
arbitrary prevision integer arithmetic.

This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Thomas Burch (tburch1@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Sajan Patel (savipate@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work   |
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work|into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.|

Thomas Burch spent _24_ hours working alone.
Sajan Patel spent _18_ hours working alone.
We spent _48_ hours working together.
Thomas Burch spent _28_ hours driving.
Sajan Patel spent _24_ hours driving.
