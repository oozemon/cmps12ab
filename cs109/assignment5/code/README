This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Prateek Bhatt (pbhatt1@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Marvin Corro (mcorro1@ucsc.edu)
We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and 
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should 
be spent working alone. Any work done by the solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together, 
learning from each other, not to divide the work into two pieces
witch each partner working on a different piece. 
Prateek Bhatt spent 5 hours working alone.
Marvin Corro spent 5 hours working alone.
We spent 24 hours working together.
Prateek Bhatt spent 11.5 hours driving.
Marvin Corro spent 12.5 hours driving.
